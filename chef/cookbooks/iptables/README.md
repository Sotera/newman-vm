# iptables Cookbook
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/iptables.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/iptables) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/iptables.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/iptables)

Installs iptables and provides a custom resource for adding and removing iptables rules

## Requirements
### Platforms
- Ubuntu/Debian
- RHEL/CentOS and derivatives

### Chef
- Chef 12.5+

### Cookbooks
- none

## Recipes
### default
The default recipe will install iptables and provides a ruby script (installed in `/usr/sbin/rebuild-iptables`) to manage rebuilding firewall rules from files dropped off in `/etc/iptables.d`.

### disabled
The disabled recipe will install iptables, disable the `iptables` service (on RHEL platforms), and delete the rules directory `/etc/iptables.d`.

## Attributes
 `default['iptables']['iptables_sysconfig']` and `default['iptables']['iptables_sysconfig']` are hashes that are used to template /etc/sysconfig/iptables-config and /etc/sysconfig/ip6tables-config. The keys must be upper case and any key / value pair included will be added to the config file.

## Custom Resource
### rule
The custom resource drops off a template in `/etc/iptables.d` after the `name` parameter. The rule will get added to the local system firewall through notifying the `rebuild-iptables` script. See **Examples** below.

NOTE: In the 1.0 release of this cookbook the iptables_rule definition was converted to a custom resource.  This changes the behavior of disabling iptables rules. Previously a rule could be disabled by specifying `enable false`. You must now specify `action :disable`

## Usage
Add `recipe[iptables]` to your runlist to ensure iptables is installed / running and to ensure that the `rebuild-iptables` script is on the system. Then create use iptables_rule to add individual rules. See **Examples**.

Since certain chains can be used with multiple tables (e.g., _PREROUTING_), you might have to include the name of the table explicitly (i.e., _*nat_, _*mangle_, etc.), so that the `/usr/sbin/rebuild-iptables` script can infer how to assemble final ruleset file that is going to be loaded. Please note, that unless specified otherwise, rules will be added under the **filter** table by default.

### Examples
To enable port 80, e.g. in an `my_httpd` cookbook, create the following template:

```text
# Port 80 for http
-A FWR -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```

This template would be located at: `my_httpd/templates/default/http.erb`. Then within your recipe call:

```ruby
iptables_rule 'http' do
  action :enable
end
```

To redirect port 80 to local port 8080, e.g., in the aforementioned `my_httpd` cookbook, create the following template:

```text
*nat
# Redirect anything on eth0 coming to port 80 to local port 8080
-A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
```

Please note, that we explicitly add name of the table (being _*nat_ in this example above) where the rules should be added.

This would most likely go in the cookbook, `my_httpd/templates/default/http_8080.erb`. Then to use it in `recipe[httpd]`:

```ruby
iptables_rule 'http_8080' do
  action :enable
end
```

## Chefspec Matchers
- enable_iptables_rule(resource_name)
- disable_iptables_rule(resource_name)
